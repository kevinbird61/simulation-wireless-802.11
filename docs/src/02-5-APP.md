## Overlay routing protocols


Edit: `Taku`

### Define:What is an overlay network?
* A network defined over another set of networks
* The overlay addresses its own nodes
* Links on one layer are network segments of lower
layers     
   * Requires lower layer routing to be utilized
* Overlaying mechanism is called tunneling
* Example: Virtual Private Networks(VPN)

### Routing on the overlay

* The underlying network induces a complete graph of connectivity(No routing required!)
    * One virtual hop may be many underlying hops away.
    * Latency and cost vary significantly over the virtual links
    * State information may grow with E(n^2)

* Overlay network users may not be directly connected to the overlay nodes
* User must be redirected to a “close by” overlay node

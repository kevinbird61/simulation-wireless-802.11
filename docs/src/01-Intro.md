## Introduction

Project 2 is aim to anaylze the source code of 802.11 mechanism. Using MATLAB source code to illustrate how does it work.

Obviously, the work can be divided into several part:

1. Power consumption (Radio Propagation, Mobility, PHY)
    * transmition rate
    * transmition power
    * distance
2. Interference among nodes (NET, APP)
    * overlay
3. Internal receiving mechanism in each node. (MAC)
    * contention window mechanism
    * re-transmit mechanism

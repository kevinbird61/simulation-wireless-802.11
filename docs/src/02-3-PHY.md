There are `2 parts` in this section: 

* SNR-based packet capture
* Broadcast & Dynamic transmission rate and power

### SNR-based packet capture

Signal-to noise ratio(SNR), in decibels , is a measurement between receive signals and noise signals.  For wireless communication, it can be computed by Equation N.1 to N.3. The example of SNR is given in Picture N.1

* Equation N.1.

* Equation N.2.

* Equation N.3.

This ratio is unreliable if it falls into 10-15 db and its poor rate is from 16 db to 24 db, whereas the rate of 24-40 db and exceeding 41 db is good and excellent respectively.

The SNR is vital for IEEE 802.11 since if it is very low, the packet might need a re-transmission several times. Whether or not delivering a packet from source to destination will be successful is depended on transmission rate and power adjustment. The next section explains towards this adjustment.  

### Broadcast & Dynamic transmission rate and power

Another thing , a transmission power , is to save energy of devices and battery life. It also affect the transmission rate. For example, when the distance of piers is small, `the power level will be reduced and the data rate will increase to the highest possibility such that the packet can reach the destination`. 

Both the transmission power and the transmission rate is necessary for a service requirement since they can be related to packet errors during broadcasting. The further information is provided in [1].

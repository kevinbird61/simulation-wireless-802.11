## Tracing the code

### Workflow - sim1.m

Target: simulation for ***different network sizes***.

We'll have a closely look on the main program flow here, and then move to event part to have advanced appearence.

* Result - `Response Time`

* Result - `Success Rate`

### Workflow - sim2.m

Target: simulation for ***Mobility***. 

sim2.m is the `one-time` version of sim1.m

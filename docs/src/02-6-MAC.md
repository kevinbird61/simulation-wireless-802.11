### CSMA/CA( Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) 

CSMA is a protocol for carrier transmission in IEEE 802.11 network to protect a packet collision by listen-before-talk; this approach is nowadays applied to distributed coordination function(DCF). 

In DCF, there are two time periods. The first one, DCF Inter-Frame Space(DIFS), is to tell a senders whether or not the medium is idle before starting sending a packet. Another one , Short Inter-Frame Space(SIFS), is a period that the medium can send the acknowledgement and will take place after the end of DIFS. The basic example is shown in Figure N.1

However, the method above can bring about collisions in the case that there are two or more stations sense the medium idle and try to transmit at the same time. In order to prevent this situation, the station should postpone access until the medium becomes idles and select a random backoff value. How to medium protect collisions and choose this value is fully explained in course material(Please see in the NCKU moodle)

### Virtual Carrier Sense and RTS-CTS-DATA-ACK

 RTS/CTS is defined to solve the hidden terminal problem found in wireless that use CSMA.  Importantly, the sender and receiver perform a handshake mechanism by exchanging RTS(Request to send) and CTS(Clear to send) control frame. 
 
 This approach will begin after waiting the DIFs time; then the sender send RTS to receiver prior to transmission of data frame. After awaiting SIFs, the receiver will respond with CTS including the successful handshake frame to make sure that the medium is reserved for transmission. 
 
Moreover, RTS/CTS employs Virtual Carrier Sensing so as to inform other stations that there is packet broadcasting in the network by RTS and CTS frames including  the duration when the sender and the receiver complete the transmission.  As a result, all stations around this area will then set their NAV(Network Allocation Vector) after obtaining these frame so that they can know the period that they need to wait for the completion of the transmission. 

The RTS/CTS mechanism is provided in Figure N.2.

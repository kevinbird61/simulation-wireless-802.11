## Usage

* This repository is worked on `octave 4.0.0`. (For free usage)
    * But original one is running on `MATLAB`
    * So have missing function, like `db` for signal-to-noise ration.

* If you want to use in matlab version, please using checkout to `matlab` branch!

```bash
$ git checkout matlab
```

* or directly clone the branch `matlab`
```
$ git clone -b matlab https://github.com/kevinbird61/simulation-wireless-802.11.git 
```
